# BillPayer_V2

To run the project successfully, follow the steps below. All database procedures, migrations, and menu data will be automatically applied when the application startsâ€”provided the connection string is configured correctly.

Step 1: Configure User and Roles
  a) Register a User
  Navigate to the Register menu in the application and create a new user.
  
  b) Insert Roles Manually
  Run the following SQL query to insert roles into the database manually. (Note: This will be automated in future updates.)
      ==>
      INSERT INTO [ASPNETROLES](ID,[DISCRIMINATOR]
        ,[LISTOFMENUID]
        ,[NAME]
        ,[NORMALIZEDNAME]
        ,[CONCURRENCYSTAMP]) values (1,'ApplicationRole','1,2,3,4,5,6,7','Admin','ADMIN',GETDATE())
        
  c) Assign Role to User
  Copy the UserId of the newly registered user from the AspNetUsers table.
  Then run the following query (replace the Guid with your actual UserId):
      ==>
      INSERT INTO [AspNetUserRoles] values ('c26db347-ad1e-47a6-bf3d-10c64680b7a2',1)
      (Replace above Guid with UserId)

Step 2: secrets.json is not present in your local pc. So We need to create that. Steps for creating that :
  a) Right Click on BillPayer project and Click on 'Manage User Secrets'.
  b) Paste and Fill following json:
    ==>
        {
          "Authentication": {
            "Google": {
              "ClientId": "", //[Refer to https://console.cloud.google.com/]
              "ClientSecret": "" //[Refer to https://console.cloud.google.com/]
            }
          },
          "mailDetails": {
            "Port": 587,
            "Host": "smtp.gmail.com",
            "Email": "", [Your Email]
            "Username": "", [Your Email]
            "Password": "" //[Refer to https://myaccount.google.com/u/4/apppasswords]
          }
        }

After completing both steps above, your application should be ready to run.
Make sure your connection string is correctly configured in appsettings.json or user secrets
